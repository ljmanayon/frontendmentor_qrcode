## My process

I'm no expert. I have to read the documentation again and again about HTML and CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

As a newbie, reading the documentation is very important. I thought watching videos, a little coding exercise here and there is enough. You have to challenge yourself and write more codes when you can.

### Continued development

For now, I just want to improve my html and css, and once I'm comfortamble, I should learn javascript.
